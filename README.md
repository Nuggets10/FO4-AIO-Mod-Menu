# ðŸš€ | Usage
Open Fallout4, doesn't matter if you're using F4SE or the Vanilla installation. 
While Fallout4 is running, open the .exe provided in any of the releases. By clicking on a button the corresponding command will be prompted to the in-game console.
**NOTE**: due to limitations, the commands will be prompted to the console only when in Windowed or Borderless mode. At the moment Fullscreen mode won't work with the AIO Mod Menu.
